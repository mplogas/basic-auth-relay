# basic-auth-relay

A quick and dirty basic auth ASP.NET Core sample including basic-auth-relaying to a hidden App Service on Azure. Usually, using a JWT would make more sense here, but requirements are requirements. The sample is loosely based (read: heavily modified and extended) on this sample by @dotnet-labs: https://github.com/dotnet-labs/ApiAuthDemo
